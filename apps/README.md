# Multi-Language Patterns Workspace

This workspace contains small illustrative projects in multiple languages, each demonstrating basic structure, patterns, or test setup. Use Copilot to explore and expand upon these examples.

## Folder Overview

- **angular/**: Minimal Angular application showcasing modular feature structure (core services, feature module, routing, shared utilities/components).
- **c-sharp/**: C# solution with a singleton-style logger library (`LoggerLib`) and accompanying test harness project.
- **cpp/**: C++ sample project (CMake) centered around pattern demonstrations via `PatternsApp` sources.
- **go/**: Simple Go program (`main.go`) as a lightweight entry point for pattern or concurrency examples.
- **java/**: Maven-based Java project skeleton with standard `src/main` and `src/test` layout for examples.
- **python/**: Python package illustrating producer/consumer pattern with tests and requirements file.
- **typescript/**: Small TypeScript module with Jest configuration demonstrating basic unit testing setup.
